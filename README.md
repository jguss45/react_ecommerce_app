This is a [Next.js] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The main goal of this project was to practice building a modern, fully responsive, full stack application.

Some bonus things to be learned along the way include:

Modern design, animation, content management (in this case using Sanity), cart functionality, and integration with Stripe
